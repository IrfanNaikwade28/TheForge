One of the Best Gyms in Kolhapur and the best in Kasba Bawada area.
They haven't compromised on the equipments they are using Life Fitness's and Hammer Strength's equipments. They even have Hammer Strength's deadlift platform which is biggest plus point.
From the owners to the Gym trainers, by far the nicest and knowledgeable staff.
A Clean Gym, the changing rooms are cleaned regularly. They also have a centralized Air conditioning system.
Only downside here is it gets crowded in the evening and as there is less space you'll have to wait longer in between sets.
Even the Weights are little harder to take in and out from the bars.

Professional Gym trainer's and highly gym machine one of the best gym. Best staff

I want to create landing page website in React tailwind.


I have hero.png , I want to use this for herosection.
and also having logo.png


Color theme:
🔥 60% — Dominant Color (Foundation)
🖤 Deep Matte Black

Hex: #0F0F0F

Use for:

Main background

Hero section base

Footer

Large areas

Why?
Black = strength, discipline, serious training environment.
It makes your orange hit hard.

⚫ 30% — Secondary Color (Support)
🩶 Charcoal Dark Gray

Hex: #1A1A1A

Use for:

Cards

Feature sections

Pricing boxes

Trainer blocks

Alternate sections

Why?
Adds depth without breaking the dark gym aesthetic.
Prevents the site from looking flat.

🧡 10% — Accent Color (Power Moves Only)
🔥 Forge Orange

Hex: #F04A1D

Use for:

CTA buttons

Highlights

Icons

Underlines

Important numbers (4.4 ⭐, 220 members)

Hover effects

Why?
This is your energy color.
If you overuse it, it loses impact.
Keep it powerful and controlled.

👇 Quick Visual Example

Background → #0F0F0F
Cards → #1A1A1A
Buttons → #F04A1D
Text → #FFFFFF
Secondary text → #B8B8B8

💪 Bonus (Optional Micro Accent)

If you want slight premium depth:

Hover Orange → #C83410

But still keep orange usage within that 10% rule.
